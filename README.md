# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors-task
This is a Rock, Paper and Scissors game created using python.
It usually involves two players who can select either of the three options - Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
In a situation where both users select the same option, it is a tie.
The winning rules are as follows:
1. Rock smashes scissors
2. Paper covers rock
3. Scissors cuts through paper

This means that which ever user selects rock where the other selects scissors, the first user wins, and if one selects paper while the other selects rock, the user with the 'paper option' wins and lastly, where one user selects scissors. and the other selects paper, the user with the 'scissors' option wins.
